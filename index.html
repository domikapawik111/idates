    Nokia mobile is planning on releasing a new LTE feature phone, which is labeled as TA-1316.
    This version of the phone is a dual SIM and will be supporting GSM, LTE, and WCDMA networks.
    The FCC documents revealed the back of the phone, which shows that TA-1316 will probably be coming with a simple VGA camera.
    The phone will also feature FM radio, Bluetooth, and will have a removable 1150mAh battery.
    The maximum obtained SAR values are within the accepted range for this phone.
    The FCC document also revealed that TA-1316 will be boxed with the basic AC-18U Nokia charger, WH-108 earphones, and 1m long CA-190CD USB cable.
    So, next to Nokia 7.3, Nokia 6.3 and Nokia 2.4, we could expect a new LTE feature phone.
    Now, the only thing missing is the location and date of the announcement event since IFA might share the destiny of CES and MWC.
